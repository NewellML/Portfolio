        This is my starfield project. This creates lots of particles and send them flying from the center. Pressing the mouse will reverse the direction. The difficult part of this project was understanding how the trigonometry works to send the particles in the directions they move and for randomizing the location in the circle. I solved this through experimentation with the different trigonometry and by thinkingit out on paper as to how each works. Along with this making the very large constructors and getting all the right random values was not exactly difficult it was just a lot of work.
