    This is my dice project. What this program does is roll nine dice every time you click. The dots near the bottom of the screen are in a race and depending on how many of their number gets rolled they will move a certain amount. The first dot to reach the finish will win the race. Some of the challenges with the code was figuring out a way to make the dots react to the rolling of the dice. Currently I'm doing that with an excessive amount of if statements. In the future I hope to bring down the lines of code by putting the objects into an array and then use a forloop with the if statements.
