        <p>This page is all about me. My name is Liam Newell and I'm the creator of this website. I'm a senior at Rosemount High School and I made this site in my Advanced Computer Science Class. I participate in a lot of different after-school activities such as marching band, onstage, DECA and NHS. I also have two older brothers and I'm hoping to attend college next year for an MIS degree. The picture to the right is me in Ireland with a chicken on my head. Enjoy the site!</p>
