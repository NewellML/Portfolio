    This is my lightning project. Basically what this program does is draw a line from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen that is meant to look like lightning. On the bottom of the screen there is a zombie that avoids these lightning strikes. Whenever lightning strikes he moves away from the lightning and eventually ends up in the corner.
