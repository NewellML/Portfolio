    This is my chemotaxis project. This project is a game in which you have control over the blue cell. This blue cell is being chased by red cells and each time you press the mouse the red cells will multiply. Multiplying the cells makes the game more difficult but it also increases your score. If you get hit by a red cell you will lose and the score will reset. Keep multiplying the amount of cells as much as you can before losing. The most difficult part of this project was figuring out how to deal with all of the red cell objects in an array. Specifically making references to these objects was difficult. I had to deal with this to program the different forms of contact. Eventually I got it all sorted out through just trial and error.
